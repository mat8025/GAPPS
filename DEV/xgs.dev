                               XGS  DEVELOPMENT

04/23/08   -- added wob showRxRy -- need to revise motion/pointer events -- fixed Menu Highlite MC_GC

04/28/08   -- axnum added to setwo --- clipborder one pixel outside drawarea?? axislines on cliparea
              need drawaxisborder


11/18/08   --- restart development on XGS
           ---  wob  buttons , onoff, state, radio , menu ,text

11/29/08   --- events needs rework --- especially event linked queque

12/02/08   ---  window sweep area release bug

12/26/08   --- interact -WO_GRAPH to send event when clicked
           --- need menu selection movement while no buttons

12/27/08   --- added Wob::getRxRy send_event_msg -- now sends rx,ry of clicked in Wob

12/28/08   --- sticking key event ?


05/01/09   --- update_wo, drawValue -- just update (redraw the value field)   2.7.1

06/11/09   --- reworking events using new, delete TBD check mem leak



///  Wo function 
       mFunc
       asl has name of Wo function --- sets that into  wo's WTF field
       when wo is activates  usually by click
       xgs looks up function via hash table and calls that
       the most recent event wo->cev that activates the wo --- is available
       this has the info as to x,y button etc


       The hash table has been set up with addresses to Wob functions via
       following instructions in womf_init() ...
       j = set_womf("ScreenNav");
       Womf_Table[j].pmf = &Wob::ScreenNav;

       so the lookup via name is relatively quick.

       However once the funcion has been found then a shortcut using ptr to member function
       will be used.


11/22/09  Wo base class - other Wo types are derived Button,Graph, Text ...
11/23/09  BUG 1 { resize of screen other than 0 -- mouse cursor initial pos is off screen }  
11/23/09  rework axis_num - autonumber works now
11/23/09  fhue,bhue,clipfhue,clipbhue   colors in wo area, cliparea
11/24/09  wrctile -- tiles windows into screen
11/24/09  why is XGS-ASL comm startup so slow ?
11/24/09  ASL->GWM error win -- want it to show in screen 15 
11/28/09  BUG 2 {plotStrInCR  -- bug pixmapstr? FIXED}
12/02/09  fix BUG 2.1 symbol pixmap bug
12/02/09  no autoredraw after move/resize ?
          wo move altered to use llc for rmove 
12/03/09  fix BUG 3 { clock text missing? }
          fix BUG 4 { plotline into window -- limited to base wo only -- not in title area }
          fix BUG 5 { wo move --- uncover background correctly ? }
          fix BUG 6 { window uncover/pop/push not preserving window image correctly }

          are pixmap draws to Wobs into a pixmap only for that Wob or into pixmap for parent window?
          check hide_wo , delete_wo ops   
          move wo while hidden - not working


12/28/09  have added ivalue,fvalue to wo - use for alternate wo id in message to ASL - can preset ivalue  
12/28/09  have activated wo cmf --- interact loop can directly call wo func
12/29/09  
02/15/10  need grid lines --- should be thinner than pen

12/25/11  have both a clip region pixmap and an overlying wob pixmap 2.58
12/25/11  need a socket version - for independent locations of xgs and asl
12/25/11  fix BUG_7 plot symbols for circles in wrong place - polygons are OK 2.58
12/25/11  fix BUG_8 windows overlaps 2.58

05/02/13  updated debug (DBPR) in gwm modules
05/03/13  BUG_9 wo print has the wrong spacing - check wob.font

08/16/14  added/reworked plot threads -- thread_w.cpp -- added PT mutex
08/17/14  refactor rp params as union -- want to use as monitor for ASL shared memory ops -also redraw in graphic windows


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
08/17/14

    Added plot threads to replace the gwm_switch_board round-robin graphic server -- thread_w.cpp.
    Refactor of rp struct as union in win.h --- want to use this memory block to monitor processing of graphic operations
    in ASL (spawned) processes.

    Want to add in sockets --- xgs will listen to 4779 ? for asl clients --- then connect and provide graphics and monitoring.

    ASL icon windows should be tied to launch screen.

    Screen redraw option to tile windows.




    Sockets


     Have both xgs and asl sockets working -- as far as transferring txt messages to and fro

     But now having xgs create an ASL monitor window causes xgs to crash ---
     try creating asl window before the socket thread is created ---



     add to ASL_options   ASL_USE_SOCK

09/05/2014
      ASL monitor crash fixed --- needed a plot mutex around the operation since the listen for new 
      socket clients is another thread - all the X window ops have to operate via the PT mutex

      added intitial handshake message between GWM and asl socket client

      now have to fix the event queque between GWM and socket clients
