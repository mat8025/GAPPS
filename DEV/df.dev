///  revise datafile format capabilities


(1) read channel files --- channels can be any type (not PAN yet?)
   but they are all converted to FLOAT on read. Revise so they return an
   array of the channel datatype (it could always be converted by the setting
   on LHS e.g.  Vec= readChannel(fanme, chn_nu)
   If Vec is already set a conversion to Vec type will happen, otherwise Vec of
   appropriate type will be converted.

(2) Similar for frame files --- thses are typically FLOAT types - but should
    work for any type and preserve the type.

(3) Channels can have different BLK,SKP and sampling rates, but for cases where
    all channels are the same,  we need a simplfied read routine that reads the
    data into a 2d array where each row is made of the channels.
