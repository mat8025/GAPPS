             Use Svar --- as a key,value table
 
 Use a hash lookup --- hash of key gives up index to int vector
 which gives us an index into Svar structure of key, value pairs
 we can resize the key vector  and just add onto the Svar. The key vector will have gaps
 and we need to take care of hash collision -- i.e. lookup doesn't match key which we then 
 step through key vector index to find a unused location

 The key vector index will be a int vector of the parent Siv

 Option to have key, value1, value2, ...   record organization
   - value->setNumFields(rl)


 A non-hash version would simply search the key (first field ) of the Svar record.


 Future extension may have svar fields as 'pointers' to objects
 the type of each field could be stored as internal record


 (1) Vmf function lookup  ---    rval = S->lookup(key)
     where S is an Svar organized as key,value table
