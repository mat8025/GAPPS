  ASL is a script (C like syntax) interpreter with some rudimentary OOP extensions and some syntax for manipulating
  vector , matrix and multidimensional arrays. The interpreter produces code for a second stage stack/register engine
  as each source statement is executed. The original intent was to have a simple interface to call C/C++ DSP library
  modules. However for programs that involve multiple looping operatons the resultant speed is orders of magnitude greater
  than similar logic compiled as C++ code. With some restrictions ASL script statements can be transformed into C++
  statements and compiled. The resulting C++ executable can be linked into a DLL that can be called as a function from ASL.
  Most of the transformation can be done be by processing the original ASL code by an ASL script - casl.asl.
   The operations performed  are detailed below.




   Vector and Matrix Range Specifications
   

     A range specification in ASL   is  [begin:end:stride] so

     Vec1[2:7:1]  = Vec2 ;

     would result in Vec1 elements 2 thru 7  being filled by Vec2 ( bound checking is done internally with error reporting).

     Mat1[3][::] =  Vec1;

     would result in the collumns Mat1 row 3 (4th rows are 0-n-1)  being filled by Vec1.

     To achieve the same functionality   ASL M[b:e:s][b2:e2:s2]    is replaced by the translator script
     with    M(Crange(b,e,s), Crange(b2,e2,s2)). The CPP Vec and Matrix perform the necessary evaluation of ranges
     and then manipulate the vector/matrices appropriately.





     To be resolved

      ASL does not have comma operator so

      int n,m,k;
      is currently not allowed.

      To be checked

       a = b = c = 7;

      OOP  class inheritance, ...

       call of ASL SF functions  - via a wrapper -- side-by-side rework of functions ?
