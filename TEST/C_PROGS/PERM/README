  This is the start of an anagram solver --- I have yet to add the dictionary lookup
  but for now it simply lists all the permutations of the letters of a word.

  This is a recursive solution plus a key step of rotating the indices of the vector
  addressing the string.

  TBD --- The next step is to search the permutated string for subwords 

  usage
     ./strperm  word

  e.g.

[mark@mercury RELEASE]$ ./strperm cat

 constructing 18 cat
3 arg1 cat

cat len 3

1 :-> [ 0  1  2  ]  < c  a  t  > 
2 :-> [ 0  2  1  ]  < c  t  a  > 
3 :-> [ 1  2  0  ]  < a  t  c  > 
4 :-> [ 1  0  2  ]  < a  c  t  > 
5 :-> [ 2  0  1  ]  < t  c  a  > 
6 :-> [ 2  1  0  ]  < t  a  c  >
