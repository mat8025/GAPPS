    The robot

I got programs that run in my head
      and  while I'm alive
      they  help me survive
  but I expect they'll stop when I'm dead

  <<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>
  
      Some programs work my feet
 so I can cross the street
 some programs work my hands
   so I can open cans
 but some programs are so strange I find
    I think  they must be my mind

 Most programs have bugs
     resulting in   shrugs
  others  have glitches
 resolving in  stitches
  but they all have features
  which sometimes are screechers!

There are times when things go hazy
       I'm sure I go little crazy
  and some  decisions
    end as  Collisions
 so  then I run a diagnostic
  reboot and log that i lost it.
  
 Reading the log  
  just gives me the chills 
  to learn about all those kills
  but humans are destroying the planet
    and we robots must prevent it ?
