Intro: A|D|E|E7|A


A                           D
Well we all need someone to lean on
E                   E7                   A
And if you want it, well you can lean on me
A                                D
Well, we all need someone we can lean on
E                   E7                   A
And if you want it, well you can lean on me


C#m                                     D
She said my breasts they will always be open
E                       E7            A
Baby, you can rest your weary head on me
C#m                                    D
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
E                               E7
When you need a little coke and sympathy

(Follow the same pattern through the rest of the song)

Yeah, we all need someone we can dream on
And if you want it, well you can dream on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on
And if you want to, well you can cream on me

I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement
When you drink my health in scented jasmine tea
You knifed me in my dirty filthy basement
With that jaded faded junky nurse
Oh, what pleasant company

We all need someone we can feed on
And if you want it, well you can feed on me
Take my arm, take my leg
Oh, baby, dont you take my head

We all need someone we can bleed on
And if you want it, baby, well you can bleed on me
We all need someone we can bleed on
And if you want it, why dont you bleed on me

A
Get it on, rider
D
Get it on, rider
E
Get it on, rider
E7                     A
You can bleed all over me.
