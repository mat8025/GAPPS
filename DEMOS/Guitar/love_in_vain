The Rolling Stones rendering of this oldie is entirely different. Keith wanted 
to do this after having got hold of other RJ recordings which he hadn't heard
previously, but wanted to add something of the Stones to it. Personally, I think
this version stands on it own (IMHO).

It was recorded in G on 'Get you Ya-Ya's out in 12/8 measure. The chords are:

[intro]
| G 		| Em 	C	| G 	G7	| D		|
[verse]
| G 		| G		| G7		| G7		|
| C 		| D7		| G 	D7	| Gsus4	G 	|
| D7 	D/F# 	| Em 	C 	| G 	G7	| D		|

Em            C        G    G7 G D
But all your love's in vain

When the train come in the station I looked her in the eye
Well the train come into the station and I looked her in the eye
Whoa, I felt so sad, so lonesome that I could not help but cry

SOLO

When the train left the station, it had two lights on behind
Yea, when the train had left the station, it had two lights on behind
Whoa, the blue light was my baby, and the red light was my mind
