                                 DISK CONTENTS

     The disk included with "Signal Processing Algorithms in
Fortran and C" contains all of the source code described in
Appendices A1 through B4 in the book, plus two demonstration
programs.  The source code is in the form of source listings in the
Fortran-77 and C programming languages.  The two demonstration
programs are execute files that are designed to run only on IBM-
compatible PC's with VGA graphics and MS-DOS 3.0 (or higher).
     In addition to this document, the disk contents consist of
four Fortran-77 source files, four C source files, and two execute
files, plus backup copies of most of the files.  The Fortran and C
source files are as follows:

   Fortran file   Fortran Backup      C file     C Backup
   ------------   --------------      --------   ----------
   SPALIB.FOR     SPALIB.BAK          SPALIB.C   SPALIB.CBK
   SPTEST.FOR     SPTEST.BAK          SPTEST.C   SPTEST.CBK
   SPPLOT.FOR     SPPLOT.BAK          SPPLOT.C   SPPLOT.CBK
   SPXAMP.FOR                         SPXAMP.C   

     The source file contents are described briefly as follows:

SPALIB:     Source listings of all signal processing routines (over
            50 routines).  These should be compiled as described in
            Appendices A1 and B1.  Important:  As suggested in
            Appendix A1, you may wish (or need) to break SPALIB.FOR
            into two files, SPALIB.FOR and FFTLIB.FOR, before
            compiling.

SPTEST:     A single program that can be compiled with SPALIB and
            used to test the routines in SPALIB.  During execution,
            SPTEST should print a pass/fail message after testing
            each routine in SPALIB.  SPTEST is described in detail in
            Appendices A2 and B2.

SPPLOT:     Source listings of two subroutines that are used in the
            text, and may be used by the reader if convenient, to
            produce plot files.  The subroutines contain I/O
            statements but should nevertheless be machine-independent
            in most cases.  They produce plot files, which must then
            be plotted by the user using his or her own plot
            software.  The plot files are in the ASCII format
            described in Appendix A3.

SPXAMP:     Source listings of all programming examples in the text,
            that is, SPA0301, SPA0302, and so on.  The text contains
            only the Fortran versions of these examples, but both
            Fortran and C versions are included on the disk.

     The two execute files, each with a backup copy, are as
follows:

                DEMO1.EXE          DEMO1.BAK
                DEMO2.EXE          DEMO2.BAK

These should be helpful in demonstrating the use of many of the
algorithms.  They should be executable in PC's with VGA graphics
and MS-DOS 3.0 or higher.  They are easy to use and may be run
simply by entering "DEMO1" or "DEMO2", then following the
instructions that appear on the screen.

     DEMO1 may be used to demonstrate the following:
                Discrete transform routines
                Power spectrum and gain routines
                Filter design routines
                Digital filtering routines

     DEMO2 may be used to demonstrate the following:
                Fast correlation
                Digital interpolation
                Least-squares routines
                Parameter estimation
                Windows
                The Hilbert transformer
                Adaptive filtering

     These demonstration routines supplement the examples in the
text.  They provide useful additional examples of how to use the
algorithms and illustrate the algorithms in a way that cannot quite
be achieved in the text, but are not considered essential to
understanding the text.  That is, a PC with VGA graphics is not
considered essential to the use of the text.


                                GETTING STARTED

     If you have a PC with VGA graphics running MS-DOS 3.0 or
higher, a good first step is to run the DEMO programs and look at
some examples of interest, for example, discrete transforms or
filtering.  You will see that the routines in SPALIB have simple
calling sequences and are easy to use in your Fortran or C
programs.
     The logical first step in actually using the routines in
SPALIB is to compile SPTEST and SPALIB, link the two together, and
try to execute SPTEST.  If there are no compile errors, if SPTEST
executes successfully, and if all tests are passed, you should be
able to set up SPALIB as a library in your system and begin using
its routines.
     All of the routines in SPALIB have been tested extensively. 
Nevertheless, we know that compile and/or execution errors are
possible in computing environments that we have not anticipated,
particularly with the C version.  Appendices A1 and B1 contain
suggestions for obtaining successful compilations and executions. 
Furthermore, each routine in SPALIB is a short module, easy to
understand in most cases.  With an editor, the user can extract a
module from SPALIB and compile it separately or with a calling
program, if needed.

     Beside the text authors, there are two major contributors to
the SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS software.  One is John Salas,
Computer Systems Manager at the University of New Mexico,
Albuquerque, NM 87131.  John has used his expert knowledge of the
C language to translate all of the source code from Fortran into C,
and to make the C code as universally applicable as possible.
     The second contributor is Fred Vote at MicroGlyph Systems,
Inc., Box 474, Lexington, MA 02173.  All of the plots in the DEMO1
and DEMO2 demonstrations were made by SCIPLOT 4.0, a commercially
available product of MicroGlyph Systems.  The authors wish to thank
Fred and MicroGlyph for their cooperation.
