Demo of Kalman Filter 

   Property of Kalman  is that it minimizes the variance of the estimation error.
   Should be a linear system ! (are there any truly linear in the real world?)

   should be good for aircraft altitude



   States --- new state from last state

   State eqn

   x _k+1 = A x _k + B u _k + w_k


   Output eqn

   y _k = C x _k + z _k


   A,B,C  are matrices


   k is time index
   x  is state of system

   u  is known input
   y  is measured output

   w is process noise
   z is measurement noise


   y is corrupted by noise.
